This README is for Adrian Unkeles's code submission to a company. A ChangeMachine!

Please use the following command in the unzipped directory to compile the source and header files:

g++ -Wall ChangeMachine.cpp -o ChangeMachine

Then run the ChangeMachine.exe to determine which bills and coins you should receive for a given USD$ amount.

Regards,
-Adrian
